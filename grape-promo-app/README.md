The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `firebase deploy` 

This will deploy whatever is bundled in the `build` folder to a provisioned firebase instance. It may take up to an hour for code changes to propigate across all servers so keep that in mind when deploying.
